## Adult Income Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project is part of the work I completed during my first term in the AI & ML program at Lambton College. The focus is on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Adult Income Dataset.

#### Overview
The Adult Income Dataset is widely used for predictive modeling, particularly for classification tasks. The primary goal is to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on various demographic and employment attributes.

#### Objectives
Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis.
Gain insights into the data distribution, relationships, and patterns.
Identify and handle missing values.
Visualize key features and their impact on the target variable.
Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following attributes:

Age: Age of the individual.
Workclass: Type of employment (e.g., Private, Self-emp, etc.).
Education: Highest level of education attained.
Education-num: Number of years of education.
Marital-status: Marital status of the individual.
Occupation: Type of occupation.
Relationship: Relationship status (e.g., Wife, Own-child, etc.).
Race: Race of the individual.
Sex: Gender of the individual.
Capital-gain: Income from investment sources.
Capital-loss: Losses from investment sources.
Hours-per-week: Number of hours worked per week.
Native-country: Country of origin.
Income: Income level (<=50K or >50K).


### EDA Steps

#### 1. Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values.
Correcting data types.

#### 2. Descriptive Statistics:
Summary statistics for numerical features.
Frequency distribution for categorical features.

#### 3. Data Visualization:
Histograms and boxplots for numerical features.
Bar plots for categorical features.
Correlation matrix.

#### 4. Feature Relationships:
Analyzing relationships between features and the target variable.
Cross-tabulations and pivot tables.

#### 5. Insights and Findings:
Key patterns and trends observed.
Implications of findings for predictive modeling.


#### Tools and Libraries
Python: The primary programming language used.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
